<!-- Thank you for contributing to LMP!

If you are adding a dedicated server, please read https://github.com/LunaMultiplayer/LunaMultiplayer/wiki/Dedicated-server first,
especially:
* Your server doesn't need to be listed as "dedicated server" to show up in the server browser.
* Dedicated servers should have either a static IP address or working DynDNS
* Port forwarding should be set up statically, or at least UPnP needs to work reliably
* Dedicated servers should not be password protected
* Dedicated servers need to be available 24/7

Please confirm that you have read and verified all of the above.
